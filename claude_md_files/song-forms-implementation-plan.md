# Song Forms Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for adding comprehensive song creation and editing functionality to the HSA Songbook. The implementation leverages the existing shared form component library and follows the established vertical slice architecture.

## Implementation Steps Overview

### Step 1: Modal Infrastructure
**File:** `PRPs/1-modal-infrastructure.md`
- Create reusable Modal component using HTML dialog element
- Implement focus management and accessibility
- Add modal context for nested modals
- Create modal animations and responsive design

### Step 2: Song Validation & Schemas
**File:** `PRPs/2-song-validation-schemas.md`
- Extend existing Zod schemas for complete song form validation
- Implement duplicate detection logic
- Create theme normalization utilities
- Add slug generation with collision handling

### Step 3: Song Form Components
**File:** `PRPs/3-song-form-components.md`
- Create SongForm component using shared form library
- Implement SongFormFields for organized field layout
- Add theme autocomplete with controlled vocabulary
- Create source dropdown with predefined options

### Step 4: API Integration & Mutations
**File:** `PRPs/4-song-api-mutations.md`
- Create useSongMutations hook for CRUD operations
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Add offline queue for PWA support
- Integrate with existing songService

### Step 5: UI Integration & Triggers
**File:** `PRPs/5-ui-integration-triggers.md`
- Add plus button to header for song creation
- Add edit buttons to SongCard components
- Implement permission-based UI visibility
- Create success/error notifications

### Step 6: Advanced Features
**File:** `PRPs/6-advanced-song-features.md`
- Implement duplicate song detection and warnings
- Add admin tools for merging duplicates
- Create rating system with review storage
- Add arrangement creation within song form

### Step 7: Testing & Validation
**File:** `PRPs/7-comprehensive-testing.md`
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for form-to-API flow
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Performance and accessibility testing

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Already Available
1. **Complete Form Component Library** (`src/shared/components/form/`)
   - All form components with TypeScript support
   - Validation integration with Zod
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   - Style converter utilities

2. **Backend API Ready** (`server/features/songs/`)
   - Complete CRUD endpoints
   - MongoDB schemas with validation
   - Authentication middleware
   - Compression for chord data

3. **Frontend Services** (`src/features/songs/services/`)
   - Complete songService with all CRUD methods
   - Caching and retry logic
   - Error handling

4. **Partial Validation** (`src/features/songs/utils/`)
   - Basic field validation schemas
   - Some Zod schemas in shared validation

### ⚠️ What Needs Implementation
1. **No Modal Infrastructure**
   - Need to create reusable modal component
   - Focus management and accessibility

2. **No Song Forms**
   - SongForm component doesn't exist
   - SongFormModal not implemented

3. **Missing UI Triggers**
   - No plus button in header
   - No edit buttons on song cards

4. **Incomplete Validation**
   - Missing arrangement fields
   - No duplicate detection
   - No theme normalization

5. **No Mutation Hooks**
   - useSongMutations not implemented
   - No optimistic updates

## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
└── Layout (Header with plus button)
    └── SongFormModal
        └── Modal (reusable)
            └── SongForm
                ├── FormSection (Basic Info)
                │   ├── FormInput (title)
                │   ├── FormInput (artist)
                │   └── FormInput (year)
                ├── FormSection (Categorization)
                │   ├── FormSelect (source)
                │   └── FormCombobox (themes)
                └── FormSection (Notes)
                    └── FormTextarea (notes)
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Form Component → Validation → Mutation Hook → API Service → Backend → Database
                    ↓                            ↓
              Error Display              Optimistic Update
```

### State Management
- Form state: React Hook Form or controlled components
- Global state: React Context for modal state
- Server state: React Query or custom hooks with caching
- Offline state: LocalStorage queue

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in shared form library
- Maintain vertical slice architecture
- Use feature-based exports

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for API flows
- Snapshot tests for UI components
- Performance tests for large forms

### Accessibility Requirements
- ARIA labels on all form fields
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management in modals

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load modal components
- Debounce API calls for search
- Optimistic updates for mutations
- Service worker caching for offline

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can create new songs via modal form
- [ ] Users can edit existing songs
- [ ] Form validates before submission

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Modal Focus Issues**
   - Mitigation: Use focus-trap library
   - Fallback: Portal implementation

2. **Form State Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use React Hook Form
   - Fallback: Controlled components

3. **Offline Sync Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Timestamp-based resolution
   - Fallback: Manual conflict resolution

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**

   - Review at each step

2. **Integration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test early and often
   - Use feature flags
