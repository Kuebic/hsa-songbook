# ✅ ACE Editor Implementation - Integrated Syntax Highlighting

## Solution Implemented

After thinking hard about the separation issue between text and syntax highlighting, I've implemented a proper solution using **ACE Editor** - the same approach used by the inspiration repository (hsa-songbook-react).

## Key Improvements Over Previous Approach

### Before (Overlay Approach - Problematic):
- ❌ Separate text layer and highlight layer
- ❌ Potential alignment issues between text and highlights
- ❌ Complex scroll synchronization
- ❌ Performance issues with large documents
- ❌ Semi-transparent text overlay causing visual artifacts

### After (ACE Editor - Integrated):
- ✅ **Integrated syntax highlighting** - no separation between text and colors
- ✅ **Professional editor experience** - same as VS Code, GitHub, etc.
- ✅ **Custom ChordPro mode** with proper tokenization
- ✅ **Native performance** - ACE handles large documents efficiently
- ✅ **Built-in features** - search, replace, undo/redo, etc.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Custom ChordPro Mode for ACE
Created `/src/features/arrangements/utils/aceChordProMode.ts`:
- Custom highlight rules for ChordPro syntax
- Proper tokenization of chords, directives, sections, and comments
- Theme with light/dark mode support

### 2. ACE Editor Integration
Updated `ChordSyntaxHighlight.tsx` to use ACE Editor:
```typescript
<AceEditor
  ref={aceEditorRef}
  mode="chordpro"  // Custom mode
  theme="textmate"
  value={value}
  onChange={onChange}
  // ... integrated highlighting
/>
```

### 3. Syntax Highlighting Patterns
- **Chords** `[C]`, `[Am7]`: Blue, bold
- **Directives** `{title: ...}`: Purple
- **Sections** `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`: Green, uppercase
- **Comments** `# comment`: Gray, italic

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Separation**: Text and highlighting are rendered together by ACE
2. **Professional Quality**: Industry-standard editor used by millions
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add autocomplete, snippets, etc.
4. **Performance**: Handles large files with virtual rendering
5. **Accessibility**: Built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support
6. **Mobile Ready**: Touch support and responsive design

## Example ChordPro with Integrated Highlighting

```
{title: Amazing Grace}
{key: G}
{tempo: 72}

[Verse 1]
[G]Amazing grace, how [G7]sweet the [C]sound
That [G]saved a wretch like [D]me
I [G]once was lost, but [G7]now am [C]found
Was [G]blind but [D]now I [G]see

# This is a comment
{start_of_chorus}
[Chorus]
[G]Grace, [C]grace, God's [G]grace
{end_of_chorus}
```

All elements are highlighted directly in the editor without any overlay or separation!

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/src/features/arrangements/utils/aceChordProMode.ts` - ACE mode definition
2. `/src/features/arrangements/components/ChordSyntaxHighlight.tsx` - ACE integration
3. `package.json` - Added `react-ace` and `ace-builds` dependencies

The implementation now matches the professional approach used in the inspiration repository!
