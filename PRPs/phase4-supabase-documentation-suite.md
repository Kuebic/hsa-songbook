## üöÄ Local Development

### Quick Setup

Get started with local development in minutes:

```bash
# One-time setup
npm run setup:local

# Daily development
npm run dev:local
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Environment Configuration

The project uses different environment files for different stages:

| File | Purpose | Git Tracked |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.env.example` | Template with all variables | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `.env.local` | Local development | ‚ùå No |
| `.env.staging` | Staging environment | ‚ùå No |
| `.env.production` | Production environment | ‚ùå No |

### Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev:local` | Start with local Supabase |
| `npm run supabase:status` | Check service status |
| `npm run db:reset` | Reset database with seeds |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `npm run types:generate` | Update TypeScript types |

### Database Management

We use Supabase for our backend:

- **Local Development**: Docker-based Supabase stack
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled in `supabase/migrations/`
- **Seed Data**: Automatic loading on reset
- **Studio**: Visual database management at http://localhost:54323

See [Database Workflows](docs/WORKFLOWS.md#database) for detailed procedures.

# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### üê≥ Docker Issues

#### Problem: Docker daemon not running
**Error**: `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`

**Solution**:
```bash
# macOS/Windows: Start Docker Desktop
# Linux: Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**Prevention**: Configure Docker to start on boot

---

#### Problem: Insufficient Docker resources
**Error**: `Container exited with code 137`

**Solution**:
1. Open Docker Desktop settings
2. Increase memory to at least 4GB
3. Restart Docker

---

### üîå Port Conflicts

#### Problem: Port 54321 already in use
**Error**: `bind: address already in use`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :54321
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Alternative**: Change port in `supabase/config.toml`

---

### üì¶ Migration Errors

#### Problem: Migration checksum mismatch
**Error**: `Checksum mismatch for migration`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Force reset (loses local data)
supabase db reset --force
```

**Prevention**: Never edit committed migration files

---

### üî§ Type Generation Issues

#### Problem: Types not updating after migration
**Error**: TypeScript errors after schema change

**Solution**:
```bash
# Regenerate types
npm run types:generate
# Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
Cmd+Shift+P -> "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

---

## Platform-Specific Issues

### macOS

- **Homebrew Installation**: Ensure `/opt/homebrew/bin` is in PATH
- **Rosetta**: M1/M2 Macs may need Rosetta for some containers

### Windows

- **WSL Required**: Install WSL 2 for best performance
- **Path Issues**: Use forward slashes in .env files

### Linux

- **Docker Permissions**: Add user to docker group
- **SELinux**: May need to adjust policies for containers
```

### Integration Points

```yaml

```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Documentation Completeness

```bash
# Check all files exist
test -f README.md || echo "README missing"
test -f QUICKSTART.md || echo "QUICKSTART missing"
test -f ONBOARDING.md || echo "ONBOARDING missing"
test -f docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md || echo "TROUBLESHOOTING missing"
test -f docs/WORKFLOWS.md || echo "WORKFLOWS missing"
test -f docs/QUICK-REFERENCE.md || echo "QUICK-REFERENCE missing"

# Check word counts (minimum content)
wc -w QUICKSTART.md | awk '{if ($1 < 200) print "QUICKSTART too short"}'
wc -w docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md | awk '{if ($1 < 500) print "TROUBLESHOOTING too short"}'

# Expected: All files present with substantial content
```

### Level 2: Link Validation

```bash
# Check internal links
grep -oh '\[.*\](.*.md)' README.md QUICKSTART.md ONBOARDING.md | while read link; do
  file=$(echo $link | sed 's/.*(\(.*\))/\1/')
  test -f "$file" || echo "Broken link: $file"
done

# Check external links (requires curl)
grep -oh 'https://[^)]*' *.md docs/*.md | while read url; do
  curl -f -s --head "$url" > /dev/null || echo "Dead link: $url"
done

# Expected: No broken links
```

### Level 3: Command Testing

```bash
# Extract and test commands from documentation
grep '```bash' -A 10 QUICKSTART.md | grep -v '```' | while read cmd; do
  # Skip comments and empty lines
  [[ "$cmd" =~ ^#.*$ ]] && continue
  [[ -z "$cmd" ]] && continue
  
  # Test if command exists
  command_name=$(echo $cmd | awk '{print $1}')
  which $command_name > /dev/null || echo "Command not found: $command_name"
done

# Test npm scripts mentioned in docs
grep 'npm run' *.md docs/*.md | sed 's/.*npm run /npm run /g' | sort -u | while read cmd; do
  npm run --silent 2>&1 | grep -q "${cmd#npm run }" || echo "Missing script: $cmd"
done

# Expected: All commands valid
```

### Level 4: User Journey Testing

```bash
# Simulate new developer experience
# This would be manual testing following the docs

echo "Manual Testing Checklist:"
echo "[ ] Follow QUICKSTART from clean state"
echo "[ ] Time the setup (should be < 15 min)"
echo "[ ] Try each troubleshooting solution"
