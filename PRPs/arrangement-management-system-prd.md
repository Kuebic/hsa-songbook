# Product Requirements Document: Arrangement Management System

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The HSA Songbook currently manages songs effectively but lacks a comprehensive system for creating, managing, and organizing multiple musical arrangements of the same song. Users need the ability to create different chord arrangements with varying keys, tempos, difficulty levels, and musical interpretations while maintaining a seamless workflow from arrangement creation to ChordPro editing.

### Proposed Solution
Develop an integrated arrangement management system that extends the existing song management functionality with:
- Structured arrangement creation workflow with auto-generated titles
- Musical metadata management (key, tempo, time signature, difficulty, tags)
- Seamless integration with existing ChordPro editor
- Pre-population capabilities for common songs from database
- Multi-user arrangement contributions with proper permissions

### Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: 80% of active users create at least one arrangement within 30 days
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Average time from song selection to ChordPro editor reduced to <2 minutes
- **Data Quality**: 90% of arrangements have complete musical metadata (key, difficulty, tags)
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating for arrangement creation experience

### Resource Requirements
- **Development**: 6-8 weeks (Phase 1), 13-18 weeks (Complete System)
- **Design**: Leverage existing UI patterns with music-specific enhancements
- **Database**: Extend current PostgreSQL schema (already architected)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation with music directors and worship teams

## 2. Market Analysis

### Market Opportunity
The music arrangement management software market shows strong growth potential:
- **Music Software Market**: $4.15B → $17.35B by 2034 (17.22% CAGR)
- **Church Management Software**: $246.9M → $517.81M by 2032 (9.7% CAGR)
- **Worship-Specific Solutions**: Significantly underserved with existing tools being either too general (MuseScore, Sibelius) or too limited (OnSong, basic chord chart apps)

### Competitive Landscape

#### Direct Competitors
- **Planning Center Services**: $14-21/month, limited arrangement customization
- **OnSong**: $29.99 one-time, iOS only, basic chord management
- **WorshipTools Charts**: Specialized but limited collaborative features

#### Indirect Competitors
- **MuseScore**: Free but lacks worship-specific workflows
- **Ultimate Guitar**: Consumer-focused, not designed for worship teams
- **Sibelius/Finale**: Professional notation software, complex and expensive

### Market Gaps Addressed
1. **Worship-First Design**: Purpose-built for church music teams
2. **Collaborative Arrangement Creation**: Multiple users contributing arrangements
3. **Intelligent Metadata Management**: Auto-generation with musical context
4. **Seamless Chord Editing Integration**: Direct pathway to ChordPro editor

### Database Design

#### Existing Schema Enhancement
The current database schema already supports arrangements perfectly:

```sql
-- Arrangements table (existing, well-designed)
CREATE TABLE arrangements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  song_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES songs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  chord_data TEXT NOT NULL,
  
  -- Musical metadata (existing fields)
  key VARCHAR(10),           -- REQUIRED for transposition
  tempo INTEGER,             -- OPTIONAL
  time_signature VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT '4/4',  -- DEFAULT to 4/4
  difficulty VARCHAR(20) CHECK (difficulty IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')),
  description TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  
  -- Metadata
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  views INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Required Enhancements**:
- Add validation constraint to ensure `key` is NOT NULL
- Index optimization for arrangement queries by song_id + key + difficulty

### Technology Stack Assessment

#### Current Stack (Recommended to Continue)
- ✅ **React 19.1 + TypeScript 5.8**: Excellent for complex form interactions
- ✅ **Vite 7.0**: Fast development with HMR for rapid iteration
- ✅ **Supabase PostgreSQL**: Optimal for music metadata relationships
- ✅ **ChordSheetJS 12.3.1**: Mature ChordPro parsing with active community
- ✅ **Zod validation**: Already proven for song form validation

#### Recommended Additions
- **tonal.js**: Music theory calculations for key validation and suggestions
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for complex arrangement workflows
- **React Hook Form v7**: Enhanced form performance for music metadata

### API Design

#### New Endpoints Required
```typescript
// Arrangement Management APIs
POST /api/arrangements                    // Create arrangement
GET  /api/arrangements/:id               // Get arrangement details
PUT  /api/arrangements/:id               // Update arrangement
DELETE /api/arrangements/:id             // Delete arrangement (own arrangements only)

// Song-Arrangement Relationship APIs
GET  /api/songs/:songId/arrangements     // List arrangements for song
POST /api/songs/:songId/arrangements     // Create arrangement for specific song

// Metadata & Suggestions APIs
GET  /api/arrangements/suggestions/names // Get arrangement name suggestions
GET  /api/arrangements/suggestions/tags  // Get tag suggestions
GET  /api/songs/:songId/chordpro-template // Get pre-filled ChordPro template
```

#### Response Schemas
```typescript
interface ArrangementResponse {
  id: string
  name: string
  song_id: string
  song: {
    title: string
    artist: string
  }
  auto_generated_title: string // "[song-name] - [arrangement-name]"
  key: string                  // REQUIRED
  tempo?: number              // OPTIONAL
  time_signature: string      // DEFAULT '4/4'

  updated_at: string
  is_public: boolean
}
```

### Integration Points

#### ChordPro Editor Integration
```typescript
interface ChordProEditorProps {
  arrangementId: string
  prefilledContent: {
    title: string           // Auto-generated: "[Song Name] - [Arrangement Name]"
    key: string            // From arrangement metadata
    tempo?: number         // From arrangement metadata (if provided)
    artist?: string        // From parent song
    composer?: string      // From parent song
    template?: string      // Common song database integration (future)
  }
}
```

#### Auto-suggestion Integration
- **Arrangement Name Patterns**: Analyze existing arrangements to suggest naming conventions
- **Musical Key Suggestions**: Based on song's existing arrangements and user preferences
- **Tag Auto-complete**: Popular tags from similar arrangements and songs
- **Common Songs Database**: Integration point for pre-filling lyrics and chord progressions

### Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- **Composite indexes**: `(song_id, is_public)`, `(created_by, created_at)`
- **Full-text search**: GIN index on arrangement names and descriptions
- **Query patterns**: Optimize for song-detail page loading all arrangements

#### Caching Strategy
- **Browser cache**: Arrangement metadata for recently viewed songs
- **Supabase cache**: Automatic query result caching for arrangement lists
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket subscriptions for collaborative editing

#### Scalability Targets
- **Arrangements per song**: Support 50+ arrangements per popular song
- **Concurrent users**: 100+ users creating arrangements simultaneously
- **Response time**: <200ms for arrangement creation, <100ms for list loading

## 5. Security & Compliance
