# Frequently Asked Questions

## Setup Issues

### Q: How long does the initial setup take?
**A**: First-time setup takes 10-15 minutes (downloading Docker images). Daily startup is <30 seconds.

### Q: Can I use my existing Docker installation?
**A**: Yes! Any Docker-compatible runtime works (Docker Desktop, Rancher, Podman, etc.)

### Q: Do I need to stop my other Docker containers?
**A**: No, Supabase uses specific ports (54321-54324) that shouldn't conflict.

## Development Workflow

### Q: How do I switch between local and cloud Supabase?
**A**: Use different .env files:
- `.env.local` for local development
- `.env.staging` for staging
- `.env.production` for production

### Q: Will this affect my existing work?
**A**: No, local development is completely isolated. Your cloud data remains untouched.

### Q: How do I share my database changes with the team?
**A**: Create a migration file and commit it to Git. Others will get it when they pull.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: What if port 54321 is already in use?
**A**: Either:
1. Stop the conflicting service, or
2. Change the port in `supabase/config.toml`

### Q: My migrations aren't applying
**A**: Run `supabase db reset` to ensure clean state with all migrations.

### Q: Types aren't updating after schema changes
**A**: Run `npm run types:generate` after migrations.

## Best Practices

### Q: Should I commit my .env.local file?
**A**: Never! It's gitignored for a reason. Commit .env.example instead.

### Q: How often should I reset my database?
**A**: Whenever you:
- Pull new migrations from Git
- Want fresh seed data
- Encounter strange data issues

### Q: Can I use production data locally?
**A**: Don't copy production data locally. Use seed data instead for privacy/security.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå Don't force adoption without training
- ‚ùå Don't ignore team feedback
- ‚ùå Don't skip early adopter phase
- ‚ùå Don't assume one-size-fits-all
- ‚ùå Don't neglect ongoing support
- ‚ùå Don't forget to celebrate success
- ‚ùå Don't rush the rollout
- ‚ùå Don't skip documentation updates

## Confidence Score: 9/10

High confidence based on comprehensive training approach, clear support processes, and iterative rollout strategy. The phased approach allows for adjustments based on real team feedback.
